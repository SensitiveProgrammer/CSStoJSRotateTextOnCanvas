# CSS to JS Rotate Text On Canvas

Rotate multi-line text on a javascript canvas using a css rotate value. I am publishing this as I have not encountered any
other way to accomplish it. This piece of code is from an old scraped project. This code has one known kink if the text on a
middle or bottom line is longer than the top line the position could be off by the middle or bottom lines offset. If you fix
this kink please post the solution under this license and link to the original code here. The code does not work out of the
box and instructions are not included.
